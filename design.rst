Design Solution
===============

Minimum Viable Product
---------------------- 
The minimum sufficient technichal solution that would allow the Safety Team to meet the current requirements model is:

 * a private email list
 * a safety team web page
 * one or more document templates (forms) for making HIA submissions

UAS operaters (and anyone else) would be able to submit hazard, incident and accident reports to the private email list. These might be held in quarentine by the mail software (because they are not members of the private list), until such time as a list moderator from the safety team released it to the list.

Safety Team members could communicate with the submitter over email directly, and include the private email list in those messages as required. Supplimentary data could be attached to emails (or referenced with links).

Deficiencies discovered in the mailing list approach could be rectified with engineering effort.


Possible Future Directions
--------------------------

IMPROVE ACCESSABILITY: Online forms that can be used from web browsers, smart phones, tablets, etc. may have advantages over document-based approaches.

ANALYTIC FEATURES: Storing structured data from submissions in a relational datbase may prove helpful for analysis and reporting.

ADDITIONAL TOOLS: The future safety management system will require more than HIA reporting and analysis, this is just the start.

COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT: Once we have started systematically improving safety, promoting that capability will become important. Doing this effectively may require development or integration of additional features.

COLABORATE ON TOOLS: If an integrated suite of safety management tools is created, and if those tools are published as open source, then they may be improved as a consequence of broader adoption. This may apply to policies and procedures as well as software.

COLABORATE ON DATA: Opening our non-confidential hazards, incident and accident reports to public scrutiny may improve the quality of the analysis, and subsequently yield better safety outcomes.

HARMONISE ACROSS GROUPS: "multi-tenanted" tools (that host multiple UAS operations) might facilitate information sharing, broader analysis and accelerate the safety improvements for participating groups and the wider community. For example common risk/hazard taxonomies may emerge, relative merits of various mitigations may be debated as a community, etc.

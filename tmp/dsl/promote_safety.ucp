CanberraUAV is a self-organising, non-profit group "staffed" by volenteers that work on open source research and development projects. We are a registerd community organisation with a bank account and a comittee (etc), but we do not have a command structure or hirarchy like a conventional organisation.

The cultural context of self-organised community groups is a significant factor in the way we can promote safety. There is very little scope for authoratitave mandates. The communication strategies most likely to succeed will involve the safety management system (and team) continuously demonstrating the merits of their activities.

Hazards, Incidents and Accidents are reported using a standard form, becuase it prompts the submitter to provide certain details that are considered useful a-priori. Where available, it may be beneficial to include additional data to augment the information in the standard form. For example telemetry logs, video and still images, audio, diagrams, journalism references, additional witness statements, etc. Unlike the fields of the standard form, these are essentially unstructured data.

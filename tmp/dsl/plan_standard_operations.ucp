There is probably a standard set of generic procedures, and activities that comply with those procedures might not require aditional planning. They are performed at the operators discression and the activity is recorded after the fact. Changes to these procedures would be subject to safety assessment.

For example, CanberraUAV flys multiple missions most weeks at the CMAC airfield. These usually involve flight testing incremental changes to software, airframes or avionics. These flights comply with the range safety plan of the CMAC site, and the Standard Operating Procedures of the Model Aircraft Association of Australia. They are usually observed by a gallery of experienced aeromodellers and always flown by a suitably qualified safety pilot.

It would be difficult and disruptive to impose manditory planning steps to Standard Operations such as these.

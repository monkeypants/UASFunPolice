Glossary
========

This document uses a mix of (hopefully) plain English with a structured
semantic model to describe the system's functional requirements.
The :ref:`requirements` section is organised by use-case, where each
use-case is implemented as a collection of system feature specifications.

The :ref:`testing` section is organised by actor and then use-case,
where each actor's use-case is described with the collection of
scenarios that the actor could use to evaluate the feature's
implementation.

+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
| subject   | language                                       |
+===========+================================================+
| Use-cases | Plain English                                  |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
| Features  | Formal Domain Specific Language (DSL)          |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
| Scenarios | Plain english version of the DSL               |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------+


Ultimately, the scenarios (A.K.A. "user stories") are the most important
thing because they are concrete, verifyable and testable. Features and
use-cases are only useful organising principles to help make sense of
the scenarios.

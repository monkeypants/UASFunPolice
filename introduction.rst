Introduction
============

Unmaned Aerial Systems (UAS) comprise some obvious hardware components like Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and physical components of the ground-segment, such as Ground Control Stations (GCSs). They also involve soft operational components, such as procedures, checklists and documention. Perhaps less obviously, they also involve soft management components, such as legal regulation, range safety rules, organisation policies, training and certification, etc.

The most important management component of any aviation operation is it's Safety Management System (SMS). The purpose of the Safety Management Tools for Unmanned Aerial Systems (SMTUAS) is to enable UAS operators to administer their own SMS to a standard that is comparable with manned aviation.

SMTUAS is free (open source) software released under the Gnu Public Licence. The development team is engaged UAS Research and Development (R&D) for of Search and Rescue (SAR) applications. Despite our narrow focus, we hope that wider group of aviatiors might find these tools useful.

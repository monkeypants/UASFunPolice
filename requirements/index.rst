Requirements
============

I will attempt to capture important quality requirements with prose, interspersed throughout the documentation. 

At a high level, the functional requirements will be described as a number of packages that group related use-cases together (use-case packages). Detailed individual use-cases will eventually be described, including who participates in them and how.

Note that in the testing documentation, individual use-cases will be validated with one or more scenarios. Some scenarios will attempt to reflect the significant messyness of real life, while other's will be deliberately simplified for the sake of clarity. These scenarios will "explain by demonstration" what the use-case is about, and also serve to drive (automated) functional tests.

The use-case packages grouped into operational, management and administrative categories.

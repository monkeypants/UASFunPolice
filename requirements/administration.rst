Administration Requirements
===========================


Manage System Configuration
---------------------------

Basically, modifying the behavior of the software by changing settings.

There will certainly be global settings of one kind or another, i.e. settings that apply to the whole system. There may be settings that apply to an individual person or to a group.

This is a supporting use-case package, it does not directly improve safety.


Manage Equipment
----------------

This is a placeholder, in anticipation that we will need to manage some information about the equipment we use. A supporting use-case package.


Manage People
-------------

this might be "people and groups" if we end up with some sort of multi-tennanted solution (i.e. the "groups" would be the tennants). Maybe one person could be a member of multiple groups... A supporting use-case package.

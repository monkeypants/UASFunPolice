Administration Requirements
===========================

We assume there will be administrative tasks that supporting operations and management. We are not really sure what they are yet...


Manage System Configuration
---------------------------

Basically, modifying the behavior of the software by changing settings. What software? What behavior? What settings? Who knows?

This is a supporting use-case package, it does not directly improve safety.

If we are changing the behavior of the system, we will require some sort of governance arangement (to analyse impacts of changes on users). This will also require record keeping that is auditable.


Manage Equipment
----------------

This is a placeholder, in anticipation that we will need to manage some information about the equipment we use. A supporting use-case package.


Manage People/Groups
--------------------

The SMS is comprised of processes and systems to make the enterprise safer. Those systems are used by people. People participate in those processes (probably with explicit roles).

Manage people includes manage accounts / access control to the systems.

If we end up designing a multi-tennanted solution, we may well need a concept of "groups" as in, each person may belong to zero or more groups, and people can create/goin/leave groups.

Management Requirements
=======================

Assess Safety
-------------
Opreational data (including planned activity) is systematically reviewed, evaluated, discussed and analysed in a timely fashion. The results of this work is fed into safety improving and promoting activities.


Improve Safety
--------------

This is where we figure out what needs to be done and do it. It's a continuous improvement, closed-loop feedback process.

It probably involves improving policies and procedures, initiating cultural change as well as other safety-improving actions.

One idea is to utilise a ticketing system (such as GitLab) for safety issues, which are referenced (or even closed) by changes to policy and procedure documentation in a version control system (such as git).


Promote Safety
--------------

Follow up on incidents, accidents and hazards by creating agenda items for group meetings (e.g. the Monday Mumble session)

Publish, distribute and promote relevant artefacts.

Other stuff too - please elaborate!

Management Requirements
=======================


Promote Safety
--------------

Key points:

 * Follow up on incidents, accidents and hazards by creating agenda items for group meetings (e.g. the Monday Mumble session).
 * Publish, distribute and promote relevant artefacts.

CanberraUAV is a self-organising, non-profit group "staffed" by volenteers that work on open source research and development projects. We are a registerd community organisation with a bank account and a comittee (etc), but we do not have a command structure or hirarchy like a conventional organisation.

The cultural context of self-organised community groups is a significant factor in the way we can promote safety. There is very little scope for authoratitave mandates. The communication strategies most likely to succeed will involve the safety management system (and team) continuously demonstrating the merits of their activities.


Improve Safety
--------------

This is where we figure out what needs to be done and do it. It's a continuous improvement, closed-loop feedback process.

It probably involves improving policies and procedures, initiating cultural change as well as other safety-improving actions.

One idea is to utilise a ticketing system (such as GitLab) for safety issues, which are referenced (or even closed) by changes to policy and procedure documentation in a version control system (such as git).


Assess Safety
-------------
Opreational data (including planned activity) is systematically reviewed, evaluated, discussed and analysed in a timely fashion. The results of this work is fed into safety improving and promoting activities.

Technical Solutions
===================

Minimum Viable Product
---------------------- 
The absolute minimum technichal solution to allow the Safety Team to support the current requirements model is:

 * a private email list
 * a Safety Team web page
 * one or more document templates (forms) for making HIA submissions

UAS operaters (and anyone else) would be able to submit hazard, incident and accident reports to the private email list. These might be held in quarentine by the mail software (because they are not members of the private list), until such time as a list moderator from the safety team released it to the list.

Safety Team members could communicate with the submitter over email directly, and include the private email list in those messages as required. Supplimentart data could be attached to emails (or referenced with links).

Any deficiencies in the mailing list approach could be rectified with subsequent engineering effort.


Possible Future Directions
--------------------------

Online forms that can be used from web browsers, smart phones, tablets, etc. may have advantages over document-based approaches.

Storing structured data from submissions in a relational datbase may prove helpful for analysis and reporting.

Features other than HIA reporting and analysis may be developed that contribute to safety in other ways.

Communication activities that promote safety may become important. Doing this effectively may require development or integration of additional software features.

If an integrated suite of safety management tools is created, and if those tools are published as open source, then they may be improved as a consequence of broader adoption. This may apply to policies and procedures as well as software.

Opening our non-confidential hazards, incident and accident reports to the broadest possible scrutiny may improve the quality of the analysis and subsequent yield a higher standard of analysis. Doing this effectively may require development or integration of specific features.

"multi-tenanted" tools (that host multiple UAS operations) might facilitate information sharing, broader analysis and accelerate the safety improvements for participating groups and the wider community.
